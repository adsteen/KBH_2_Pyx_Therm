# This is a tool

The user uploads their data and my tool perfoms the calculations. The
user can interface with the tool and change pressure, types of plots
that are displayed, and the full or partial table.

# Workflow

I am solo but I plan on polishing it up a bit it’s still a little rough
though it does work. I still need to complete the vignette and I would
like to add a unit test.I am currently working on uploading an image to
the instruction section so people can see what they need to do to input
their data so that the tool will work. That is really the important
thing. If this doesn’t work on the front end the tool will not work no
matter how many bells and whistles I add so I am working on making clear
concise instructions.

# Elements my project includes

## From your list

1.  Create a shiny application
2.  Create a package with documented functions
3.  Create a vignette
4.  Read data from a text file
5.  Add unit tests to a package

## What I think my project includes

1.  An interactive box to upload csv file data for calculation of temps
2.  Temperature calculation
3.  Ability to vary Pressure
4.  Ability to view both the full table with all of the calculations and
    a modified table with just some pertinent info.
5.  plots of temps from rims to cores
6.  plots that have lm() applied
7.  drop down menu to vary which data is plotted
8.  To keep the work area neat I have added tables for plots and data
    and instructions.
